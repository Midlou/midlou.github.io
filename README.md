This project is my 3rd attempt at creating a website where I catalog and showcase my projects as a portfolio. Unfortunately, I suffer from a small problem known as 'lack of time', so you'll quickly notice that much of the website is incomplete or entirely non-functional. 

I swear I'm trying, but the forces of chaos are strong in this domain.

This iteration of the website uses [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). I hope this is the last time I choose to switch technologies. I also use some cool things like [@tsparticles/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tsparticles/react) and [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
