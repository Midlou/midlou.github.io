# My website!

## About this project

This project is my 3rd attempt at creating a website where I catalog and showcase my projects as a portfolio. Unfortunately, I suffer from a small problem known as 'lack of time', so you'll quickly notice that much of the website is incomplete or entirely non-functional. 

I swear I'm trying, but the forces of chaos are strong in this domain.

This iteration of the website uses [Astro](https://astro.build/), ~~[React](https://react.dev/),~~ [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). I hope this is the last time I choose to switch technologies (It wasn't). I also use some cool things like [tsparticles](https://particles.js.org/) and [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
